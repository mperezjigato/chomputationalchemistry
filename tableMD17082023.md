[^1]: The GENIUS LAMMPS implementation does not containg an explicit test suite, although the system set up the test suite executables on my `.local` directory as soon as I started running LAMMPS. It is one of those .local executables that I have tried to run, and failed (Python error). I have set up a Conda virtual environment on my DSI guest2 laptop that includes a) ASE b) GPAW c) quantum-espresso d) LAMMPS, which hopefully will run fine.   
[^2]: The intern has recently noticed a possible problem with the hybrid LAMMPS
HPC (and pure OpenMP) calculations, which is fully documented in week 7's summary. According to the authors, it corresponds to a bug that persists towards the current version of LAMMPS, and only affects the elastic constant Fortran90 separate code, whenever OpenMP is switched on.
[^3]: Both strong scaling and weak scaling results have been reported in the weekly summaries. The former considers the variation of the number of cores, while keeping the system size constant. The latter includes the variation of system size accordingly to the increase in the number of cores.
